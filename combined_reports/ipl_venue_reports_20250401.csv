Eden Gardens,Kolkata,West Bengal,"Venue Description:One of the biggest sporting centres, Kolkata's Eden Garden holds a special place of interest in the history of Indian cricket. Capable of holding more than one lakh people at one stage, the capacity has now been reduced to a little more than 66,000 after the stadium underwent renovation before the 2011 World Cup.Referred as ""Cricket's answer to the Colosseum,"" the Eden Gardens, the largest cricket stadium in India, has hosted many prominent matches. The Eden Gardens crowd simply loves their sport. The first World Cup final outside Lord's was at this majestic venue. Anil Kumble's 6/12 against West Indies in the final of the 1993 Hero Cup was on this hallowed turf.Sachin Tendulkar's famous run-out during the Asian Test Championship match against Pakistan, resulted in Kolkata's mob fury in action once again - the match was eventually finished in front of empty stands. This wasn't the first time though - not to forget the previous instance, when India slumped to 120/8, chasing 252 against Sri Lanka in the semi-final of the 1996 World Cup.There have been happier times as well. The 376-run stand between VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid during the famous 2001 Test series against Australia, which inspired a famous Indian victory, came here. Rohit Sharma's belligerent ODI world record, a 173-ball 264, against Sri Lanka, in Nov 2014, also came on this famous ground.The stadium hosted its first Test in 1934, with India hosting England. While the Test match came early, it had to wait until 1987 to host its first ODI, against Pakistan. While the stadium is synonymous with cricket, until 1984, it was also used as a football venue, with several of prominent derbies being held over the maidan.How does the pitch play?The Eden Gardens track is considered as one of the better batting surfaces although spinners tend to come into action as the match wears on. Spinners have enjoyed bowling here in IPL games as well.Stats and TriviaThe highest ODI score by any batsman was made on this ground.

M. Chinnaswamy Stadium,Bengaluru,Karnataka,"Venue DescriptionM Chinnaswamy stadium, lying in the heart of the state capital, continues to remain one of the biggest cricketing centres of the country. Starting off as a humble abode, the stadium has now turned out to be a marquee venue, capable of hosting some of the biggest cricket matches to be played in the country. Home to some of the classiest match-winners of India, Chinnaswamy stadium, in its debut Test match had the honour of hosting the West Indies in 1974. The match also marked the emergence of two modern legends, Gordon Greenidge and Sir Viv Richards. Since then, the stadium has regularly hosted Tests, although it's unfortunately considered as one of India's unluckiest venues.Bangalore hosted the final Test against Pakistan in 1987, remembered more for the minefield of a pitch and the consequent 96 from Sunil Gavaskar, one of the best ever knocks played by the little master. The venue also hosted Sachin Tendulkar's last Test as India's captain, against South Africa in February, 2000, enabling Hansie Cronje's men complete a historic series win. Unlike traditional Indian pitches, Bangalore offers more pace and bounce and it's one of the biggest reasons why overseas teams enjoy playing on this surface.Floodlights were installed on this beautiful ground in 1996 and the first D/N match was the epic battle between India and Pakistan in the 1996 World Cup. The other much talked about match at this venue is the Titan Cup match between India and Australia in 1996. India sneaked home by 2 wickets after local heroes, Anil Kumble and Javagal Srinath, were involved in a stunning 52-run partnership for the unbroken ninth wicket. Bangalore also hosted two India matches during the 2011 World Cup, with the game against England ending in a thrilling tie. The ground is also a regular host of IPL matches, with RCB playing all their home games, in front of their most loyal and boisterous supporters.How does the pitch play?Short boundaries and high altitude makes the Chinnaswamy track a heaven for batters in the limited-overs formats. Many big scores have been posted and chased down with immense ease. While it’s a batting paradise in the shorter format of the game, the track tends to help the pacers in Test cricket. One of the few Indian grounds to boast of a pitch with plenty of spice, many pacers have loved exhibiting their wares in the five-day version of the game.Stats and Trivia:Rohit Sharma scored his first ODI double hundred on this ground, a fine 209 against Australia in 2013The venue was also the scene of Ireland's biggest win. They beat England in the 2011 World Cup encounter after Kevin O'Brien smashed a 50-ball 100, the fastest hundred in a WC match.byPradeep Krishnamurthy Venue DescriptionM Chinnaswamy stadium, lying in the heart of the state capital, continues to remain one of the biggest cricketing centres of the country.

MA Chidambaram Stadium,Chennai,Tamil Nadu,"Venue Description:The stadium is named after the former President of BCCI and Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, MA Chidambaram. It was formerly known as Madras Cricket Club Ground. The ground was established in 1916, making it the oldest venue in India which is in continuous use. The stadium is more commonly known as Chepauk - the locality in which it is situated.Since 2008, the venue is home to Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League. It hosted its first ever international game in 1934, a Test match between India and England, which the visitors won by 202 runs. The stadium has gone through several changes since then. The most notable ones being, the addition of floodlights in 1996 and the reconstruction in 2009 to accommodate more people and give state-of-art facility.The most fascinating thing about the ground is the crowd support. It is common knowledge that the Chepauk crowd is the most unbiased and the most knowledgeable crowd in the country. Saeed Anwar got a standing ovation when he made a record-breaking 194. When Pakistan won the 1999 Test, the team received good appreciation from the crowd. As mark of respect, the Pakistani team also took a lap of honour around the ground.How does the pitch play?When the pitches were uncovered and unattended to, it used to help the fast bowlers. However, since India started playing the spin quartet of Bishan Singh Bedi, BS Chandrasekar, S Venkatraghavan and EAS Prasanna, the wickets were made spin-friendly. Taking a look at the stats gives you a clear indication as to what type of bowlers hold the aces on the Chepauk wicket.Among the top 10 wicket-takers at the ground, nine of them are spinners and the only fast bowler on the list is Kapil Dev. Anil Kumble sits on top of the list with 48 wickets, followed closely by Harbhajan Singh - 42 wickets.Interesting facts about Chepauk:The first ever Ranji Trophy game was played at this venue. Madras' AG Ram Singh ran through Mysore with a 11-wicket haul in the match.For a long time, Chepauk hosted the famous Pongal (Harvest) Test. It used to be played in the month of January.India registered their first ever Test win at this stadium, when they beat England by an innings and 8 runs.The second tied Test in the history of cricket was played here, between India and Australia in 1986.Saeed Anwar recorded the highest individual score in ODIs - 194 - at this ground. The milestone remained for more than a decade, before Sachin Tendulkar scored 200 against South Africa.Sunil Gavaskar went past Don Bradman's 29 Test hundreds at this very venue.This ground was also witness to one of Sachin Tendulkar's greatest Test innings. The Indian maestro battled back spasms and almost took his side home against Pakistan in 1999. But his 136 went in vain as the arch-rivals sealed a 12-run victory.

Wankhede Stadium,Mumbai,Maharashtra,"Introduction:Relatively younger than old-world grounds like Chepauk, Eden Gardens and Feroz Shah Kotla, the Wankhede stadium has its own fair share of unforgettable memories attached to it. It has been home to some of the greatest cricketers to have played for the country.Venue history:Mumbai has played host to Test matches at three different venues - the first ever Test in India was hosted at the Bombay Gymkhana in 1933-34 against England. After the second World War, Cricket Club of India's (CCI) Brabourne Stadium became the city's second ground. However, a dispute between the CCI and the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) over the allocation of tickets for cricket matches forced the latter to build a separate stadium. The stadium was named after the association's president Barrister Sheshrao Krishnarao Wankhede. The initial capacity of the stadium was around 45,000. The first Test was staged in the season of 1974-75 when West Indies toured India.Venue description:The stadium has seven different stands - Sunil Gavaskar Stand, North Stand, Vijay Merchant Stand, Sachin Tendulkar Stand, MCA Pavilion, Divecha Pavilion, and Garware Pavilion.In 1996, Wankhede stadium underwent an upgrade, during which, floodlights were installed to provide excellent lighting to host the day and night cricket matches. Wankhede received its second upgrade in 2010-11 before the 2011 World Cup and the ground was unavailable for domestic and international cricket until February 2011. One of the highlights of the stadium is the suspended cantilever roofs. No beam supports on the roofs ensure better view for the spectators. The stadium has 20 elevators for North and South stands. After its renovation and installation of bucket seats the capacity of the Wankhede Stadium was reduced to around 33,000.How does the pitch play?The wicket at the Wankhede offers help for both the pacers and spinners. Close proximity to the Arabian sea helps the swing bowlers considerably, especially during early hours of the day. However, spinners have been known to benefit during the last couple of days of a Test match as the pitch turns into a vicious turner. Although the new ball does a bit in limited-overs cricket, the pitch tends to ease out and favour batsmen as the innings progresses. The venue provides great entertainment when it comes to T20 cricket.Trivia:Bangladesh scored the lowest ODI total at the stadium. They were 115 all out, when it competed with India in the 1998 season.Ravi Shastri's six sixes in an over off Baroda's Tilak Raj en route to the fastest double-hundred in first-class cricket was on this ground in 1984-85.bySonali Dhulap Introduction:Relatively younger than old-world grounds like Chepauk, Eden Gardens and Feroz Shah Kotla, the Wankhede stadium has its own fair share of unforgettable memories attached to it.

Arun Jaitley Stadium,Delhi,Delhi,"Venue Description:Home to the Delhi Ranji team and the Delhi Daredevils, the Feroz Shah Kotla, is the second oldest international cricket stadium in India. The stadium gets its name from its location. It is in the vicinity of the Feroz Shah Kotla, a fortress built by Sultan Feroz Shah Tughlaq. Having been established in 1883, the ground has undergone some heavy reconstruction over the years. Colloquially, the locals also call the stadium 'Kotla', which literally means citadel or fortress. The first international game here was a Test match between India and the West Indies in 1948.The Feroz Shah Kotla has been a very happy hunting ground for the Indian cricket team. India won 7 successive Tests between 1993-2007. In fact, India have won 9 and drawn 1 of their last 10 Tests here. India last lost a Test match here way back in 1987, a game that saw India getting bowled out for 75 in the first innings. India's ODI record at this stadium isn't bad either. Since April 2005, they have won 6 games here and lost none; one game was cancelled and one was a no result. Their last ODI defeat at Kotla came against Pakistan, where the visitors won by a margin of 159 runs. The win helped Pakistan win the ODI series 4-2 after India had taken a 2-0 lead previously.How does the pitch play?Over the years, the pitch at Feroz Shah Kotla has largely been batting friendly. However, in December 2009, the Kotla pitch came under severe criticism after an ODI between India and Sri Lanka had to be called off. The pitch was deemed unfit and dangerous after instances of atrocious uneven bounce off the pitch. Sri Lanka were 83 for 5 when the match officials decided that the game couldn't be continued further, owing to players' safety.Based on the match referee's report on the game, the stadium was in danger of getting banned for a period of 1-2 years. A ban of more than 14 months would have seen the stadium lose out on hosting any games during the 2011 World Cup. However, the ICC decided to ban it for just 12 months, paving the way for Kotla to stage its share of 4 World Cup games, including India's game against the Netherlands.Interesting Records at Feroz Shah Kotla:The stadium witnessed Anil Kumble's famous 10/74 in an innings, against Pakistan in 1999. With these figures, Kumble became only the second bowler after Jim Laker to take all the ten wickets in an innings.In 1983, Sunil Gavaskar scored his 29th Test ton at this venue, equalling Sir Donald Bradman's record for the most number of centuries in Test cricket.In 2005, Sachin Tendulkar went past Sunil Gavaskar's record of 34 Test centuries, registering his 35th Test ton in the second Test against Sri Lanka at this venue.BySidhant Maheshwari Venue Description:Home to the Delhi Ranji team and the Delhi Daredevils, the Feroz Shah Kotla, is the second oldest international cricket stadium in India.

Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium,Hyderabad,Telangana,"Venue Description:Rajiv International Stadium plays host to the Sunrisers Hyderabad. After the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) had limited access to the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium - which belonged to the Sport Authority of Telangana State - the HCA proposed to build a new stadium. Also, because of its size, the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium was considered very small to host international matches.The HCA's proposal to build a new stadium was approved immediately by the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, N.Chandrababu Naidu. There was an auction held as to who would own the ground and Visaka Industries Ltd won the bid with a total amount of Rs. 65,00,00,000. The stadium was also named after the company. However, former Chief Minister Y.S.Rajasekhara Reddy decided to name it in the memory of former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi.The first match here was played between India and South Africa in 2005. Since then, India have played 4 games at the venue and it is not a happy hunting ground as they have lost 3 out of the 5 ODIs played. However, India have had success in Tests, winning 2 out of the 3 games.How does the pitch play?Not much can be said about the wicket, as there have been very few matches played at this venue. But, generally, the wicket here is considered as a flat track, which tends to slow down as the game progresses. This means that the spinners would enjoy bowling here than the pacers.India almost chased down 350 in an ODI against Australia - Sachin Tendulkar scored 175. On the other side, India have won two Tests by an innings against New Zealand and Australia - the spinners doing most of the damage.

This means that the spinners would enjoy bowling here than the pacers.India almost chased down 350 in an ODI against Australia - Sachin Tendulkar scored 175. On the other side, India have won two Tests by an innings against New Zealand and Australia - the spinners doing most of the damage.",Not available,Not available,Not available,"Batting friendly, Assists spin, Good for pacers",27.88°C,Clear sky,41%,3.51 m/s,"2025-04-02: 33.67°C, Few clouds, 23% humidity

Narendra Modi Stadium,Ahmedabad,Gujarat,"Introduction:Popular as one of the premier cricket grounds in India, the stadium is generally known as the 'Motera Stadium' to avoid confusion with another stadium of the same name in the Navrangpura area. It is owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association and comes under the aegis of the West Zone.Venue History:Before this stadium came into existence, international matches were played at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's stadium, bearing the same name. However, in 1982, the Gujrat government donated a 50-acre land on the banks of the Sabarmati river and the Motera stadium was constructed in a span of only nine months. The first international match to be hosted here was a Test between India and West Indies on November 12, 1983.Venue Description:The Motera stadium has been witness to several important landmarks. It is also the adopted home of the Indian Premier League franchise Rajasthan Royals. The current stands are as follows - GMDC Upper and Lower stands, East Upper and Lower Pavilion, Adani Lower Pavilion, Adani Upper Pavilion, Club Pavilion, and West Pavilion. All stands, except the Club and West Pavilions, consistent two tiers. The Adani Pavilion consists of more than 20 air-conditioned corporate boxes as well as the player dressing rooms. The stadium has 21 entry gates. The ground was renovated in 2006, just before the Champions Trophy. After renovation, state-of-the-art floodlights were added to the stadium along with covered stands, three new pitches and a new outfield.How does the pitch play?The Motera offers a slow wicket. Initially, it was a bowler-friendly track but over the course of time, the pitch lost its spice as it started to slow down. Very few Test games have reached a conclusion over here.Trivia:Sunil Gavaskar became the first-ever cricketer to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket on this ground - a feat he achieved against Pakistan in 1986-87.Kapil Dev claimed his 432nd Test wicket on this ground to become the highest wicket-taker in the world, breaking Sir Richard Hadlee's record in 1993.bySonali Dhulap Introduction:Popular as one of the premier cricket grounds in India, the stadium is generally known as the 'Motera Stadium' to avoid confusion with another stadium of the same name in the Navrangpura area.

Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium,Visakhapatnam,Andhra Pradesh,"Venue DescriptionACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium, located in Pothinamallayya Palem, Visakhapatnam, is surrounded by the blissful facade of the picturesque hills and the leafy ramble of trees swaying in breeze. It is the home ground of Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League. The stadium built in 2003 is known for its excellent drainage facilities. The well-manicured, lush-green outfield at the ground has also come in for praise. The seating capacity is expected to be increased to 50,000. In fact, the Test status was also granted recently. It is the ninth ground to be awarded the Test status in India.The first ever international match at this stadium took place between arch-rivals India and Pakistan in April 2005. It was a game in which MS Dhoni announced his arrival at the highest level with a blistering innings of 148. Since then, it has gone on to host five ODIs, one T20I and IPL fixtures related to Deccan Chargers in 2012. Sunrisers Hyderabad are expected to play three games in 2015 in the IPL.Pitch Conditions:Historically, it is known for producing belters, where batsmen can play through the line on even-paced wickets. However, in recent times, spinners have made their mark. It can be exemplified by some low-scoring games in the 2013-14 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.byBharath Ramaraj Venue DescriptionACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium, located in Pothinamallayya Palem, Visakhapatnam, is surrounded by the blissful facade of the picturesque hills and the leafy ramble of trees swaying in breeze.

Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium,Dharamsala,Himachal Pradesh,"Venue description:Sitting at 1457 metres above sea level, the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium in Dharamsala, is widely regarded as the most picturesque cricket stadium in the world. With the beautiful Dhauladhar mountain range lacing its backdrop, the HPCA stadium offers one of the most stunning views to its visitors, especially when the mighty peaks are blanketed in snow.Even though international cricket made its first appearance here only in 2013, the HPCA stadium has already established itself as a world-class cricket destination in a very short time. Best known for being the abode of the Dalai Lama, this quaint little town first found its place on the cricketing world map in 2010, when Chennai Super Kings locked horns with Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League (IPL).How does the pitch play?With India losing their recent T20I against South Africa even after setting an imposing target of 200, one can easily make out that the pitch here usually offers a lot of runs. Since the ground is located at a high altitude, the ball travels faster as well. In addition, the dew becomes a major factor in the evening if you're playing during the September-March period. That's the reason why teams prefer to chase at this venue.Apart from eight IPL games, the ground has also hosted two ODIs. The first ODI at this stadium may have been a dull encounter, but India made up for it by making 330 in their next game here. Virat Kohli made 127 in that match as India managed to beat the West Indies by 59 runs, despite Marlon Samuels cracking a 106-ball 112.BySidhant Maheshwari Venue description:Sitting at 1457 metres above sea level, the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium in Dharamsala, is widely regarded as the most picturesque cricket stadium in the world.
