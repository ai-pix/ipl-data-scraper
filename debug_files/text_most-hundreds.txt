Throughout the course of the Indian Premier League, a total of 87 centuries have been scored, starting from the very first game in the league's history back in 2008 when Kolkata Knight Riders' Brendon McCullum smothered 158 off 73 against the Royal Challengers Bangalore at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.
RCB's Virat Kohli holds the record for most hundreds ‚Äî seven ‚Äî four of which he scored in his record-run-piling 2016 season where he scored 923 runs. Just below him is his former RCB teammate, Chris Gayle, who has six triple-figure scores to his name including his 175 against Pune Warriors India, which is also the highest any batter has scored in a single IPL innings. It was also the fastest IPL hundred ‚Äî off just 30 balls. David Warner, Shane Watson and KL Rahul have four hundreds each to their name while AB de Villiers, Sanju Samson and Shubman Gill had three.
The record for most hundreds in a single IPL season belongs to 2023, when 12 hundreds were registered by nine players ‚Äî with Gill scoring three and Kohli two. Whereas it was in 2009 that the least hundreds were scored in a single season ‚Äî two. The first-ever Indian batter to score an IPL hundred was Manish Pandey, who did so for RCB back in the 2009 season.
The team with the most number of centurions over the years is Punjab Kings ‚Äî formerly known as Kings XI Punjab ‚Äî with 12 batters having scored 14 hundreds for the 2014 finalists. While Rajasthan Royals also have 14 hundreds from their roster of players, they're split between seven batters.
