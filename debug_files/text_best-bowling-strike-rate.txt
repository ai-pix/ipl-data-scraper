The 18th season of the Indian Premier League 2025 starts on March 22 with a mouth-watering opening clash between MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings and Faf Du Plessis led-Royal Challengers Bangalore at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The schedule of the first 15 days was announced initially, while the roster for the remaining games is to be announced once the dates for the general elections are official.
Ahead of the 2024 edition, South African pacer and Punjab Kings bowler Kagiso Rabada tops the list for the best strike rate in the history of IPL. Rabada has bowled at a strike rate of 14.77 in his IPL career so far. He is followed by Kolkata Knight Riders bowler and West Indian pacer Andre Russell. The bowler has bowled at an average of 18.73 in his IPL career and is among one of the most lethal death bowlers in the history of the tournament.
South African leggie Imran Tahir, who won the IPL title with the Chennai Super Kings, is third on the list with a strike rate of 20.77. He is followed by Australian death bowling specialist AJ Tye, who is picking his wickets at 16.29.
Coming to last season in 2023, Mark Wood has been sensational with his average. He has been able to pick a scalp just at 8.72. Gujarat Titans' bowler Mohit Sharma follows him at an average of 9.81. Delhi Capitals player Mitchell Marsh managed 12 wickets at 10.08 last season. Mumbai Indians' sensation Akash Madhwal too has been superb in his debut season, as he picked his wickets at 10.92.
