The 18th season of the Indian Premier League 2025 starts on March 22 with a mouth-watering opening clash between MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings and Faf Du Plessis led-Royal Challengers Bangalore at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The schedule of the first 15 days was announced initially, while the roster for the remaining games is to be announced once the dates for the general elections are official.
Ahead of the 2024 edition, New Zealand spinner and former Royal Challengers Bangalore bowler Daniel Vettori tops the list for the best economy in the history of IPL. Vettori bowled at an economy of 6.56 in his IPL career so far. He is followed by fellow RCB bowler and Indian legendary leg-spinner Anil Kumble. The bowler has bowled at an economy of 6.58 in his IPL career and is among one of the best middle-over bowlers in the history of the tournament.
Australian legend and Delhi Capitals player Glenn McGrath has bowled at an economy of 6.61 in his 14-match career. He is followed by modern T20 maestro leg-spinner Rashid Khan, who goes at just 6.67 in his spells.
Coming to last season in 2023, Punjab Kings all-rounder Mathew Short has been sensational with his economy. He has been able to bowl his overs at 6.25. Delhi Capitals' Pravin Dubey too has been miserly in three overs going at just 6.33. Gujarat Titans off-spinner who played just one game for them last season bowled at 6.50. Sunrisers Hyderabad's Glenn Phillips too has been tidy going at 6.66.
