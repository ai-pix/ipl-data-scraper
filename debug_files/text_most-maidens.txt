The 18th season of the Indian Premier League 2025 starts on March 22 with a mouth-watering opening clash between MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings and Faf Du Plessis led-Royal Challengers Bangalore at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The schedule of the first 15 days was announced initially, while the roster for the remaining games is to be announced once the dates for the general elections are official.
Ahead of the 2025 edition, Indian pacer and former Sunrisers Hyderabad bowler Praveen Kumar tops the list for the most maidens in the history of IPL. Praveen bowled 14 maidens in his career. He is followed by Bhuvenshawar Kumar, another Sunrisers Hyderabad bowler, who has been the leader of the attack in the past few seasons for the side. The bowler has bowled 12 maidens in his IPL career and is one of the most miserly bowlers in the history of the tournament.
Trent Boult, who has been lethal with the new ball for Rajasthan Royals in the last couple of seasons, is third in the list with 11 maidens. He is followed by Indian fast bowling all-rounder Irfan Pathan, who bowled 10 maidens throughout his career.
Coming to last season in 2023, Trent Boult has bowled a maximum number of maidens and created the pressure early on. He tops the list with three maidens up top, followed by Delhi Capitals' Khaleel Ahmed and Mohammed Shami who bowled two maidens each. England's Mark Wood was also on the list with a solitary maiden to his name in the season.
