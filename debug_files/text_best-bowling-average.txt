The 18th season of the Indian Premier League 2025 starts on March 22 with a mouth-watering opening clash between MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings and Faf Du Plessis led-Royal Challengers Bangalore at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The schedule of the first 15 days was announced initially, while the roster for the remaining games is to be announced once the dates for the general elections are official.
Ahead of the 2024 edition, South African pacer and Delhi Capitals bowler Lungi Ngidi tops the list for the best average in the history of IPL. Ngidi bowled at an average of 17.92 in his IPL career so far. He is followed by Chennai Super Kings bowler and Australian seamer Doug Bollinger. The bowler has bowled at an average of 18.73 in his IPL career and is among one of the most lethal new ball bowlers in the history of the tournament.
England's Dimitri Mascarenhas, representing Punjab Kings, is third on the list at an average of 18.74. He is followed by Australian all-rounder and current Delhi Capitals player Mitchell Marsh who is picking his wickets at 19.22.
Coming to last season in 2023 Mark Wood has been sensational with his average. He has been able to pick wickets just at 11.81. Gujarat Titans' bowler Mohit Sharma follows him at an average of 13.37. Tristian Stubbs, who has just bowled two overs, also makes the list as he picked a wicket in his two overs bowled and averages 14. Delhi Capitals player Mitchell Marsh managed 12 wickets at 14.16 last season.
